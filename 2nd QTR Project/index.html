				<h3>Welcome to AdvocacyX!</h3>

	<h3>
		Millions and millions of environments are being taken down for big corporations to
		build malls, establishments and the like. These actions helps in Climate Change. It
		is in your hands in order to stop this or let these actions keep happening.
	</h3>

	<h5>WHAT is our Advocacy?</h5>

	<p>
	Our main advocacy is to stop the unnecessary destruction of Mother Nature which leads to Climate Change.
	We hope to make you realize the true power and beauty of nature. Although it helps corporations as they
	grow and help the economy of not only their company, but the country - even the world! But, this shouldn't
	come at the expense of Mother Nature. We want the management of properties to make sure the places
	where animals live and make families which in turn helps us. A world without proper maintenance for
	nature will not only ruin one of the most beautiful things on earth, but affect our lives as well. Did you know,
	that 90% of all carbon emissions which comes from fossil fuels and the like are being absorbed by tress. Not
	only that, but trees also help absorb rain water or flooded areas from storm surges. If we allow nature to be
	destroyed, it will only do more harm than keeping it there.
    </p>

    <h5>What REALLY is an Advocacy?</h5>

    <p>
    Advocacy is where the public combines their ideas and effort into promoting their rights or their beliefs.
	According to Advocacy Focus, "Advocacy seeks to ensure that all people in society are able to: Have their
	voice heard on issues that are important to them. Protect and promote their rights. Have their views and
	wishes genuinely considered when decisions are being made about their lives." This means that it is crucial
	for the people today to start an advocacy.
    </p>

    <h5>WHY even support this Advocacy?</h5>

    <p>
    The reason why you should support this advocacy because Climate Change could be something that could not
	only affect us all, but harm us in different ways. According to the World Wildlife Fund, "Even a small increase in
	global temperatures will destabilise the water cycle and could make water scarcity much worse. Climate
	change affects rainfall patterns, meaning both drought and flooding will be more common, and more intense."
    </p>

    <h5>WHO are you guys? Why should we believe you?</h5>

    <p>
    We are a small non-profit organization where-in we help to promote the best advocacies for a better future. We
	specialize and strive in giving people's opinions a voice in order to promote the best.
    </p>

    <h5>WHEN do we support your Advocacy?</h5>
    <p>
    	We believe that you can support any advocacy within your own time. If you feel like supporting it, then go ahead.
